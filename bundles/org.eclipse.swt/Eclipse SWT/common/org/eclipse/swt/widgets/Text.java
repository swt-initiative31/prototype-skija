/**
 * Instances of this class are selectable user interface objects that allow the
 * user to enter and modify text. Text controls can be either single or
 * multi-line. When a text control is created with a border, the operating
 * system includes a platform specific inset around the contents of the control.
 * When created without a border, an effort is made to remove the inset such
 * that the preferred size of the control is the same size as the contents.
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>Styles:</b></dt>
 * <dd>CENTER, ICON_CANCEL, ICON_SEARCH, LEFT, MULTI, PASSWORD, SEARCH, SINGLE,
 * RIGHT, READ_ONLY, WRAP</dd>
 * <dt><b>Events:</b></dt>
 * <dd>DefaultSelection, Modify, Verify, OrientationChange</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * Note: Only one of the styles MULTI and SINGLE may be specified, and only one
 * of the styles LEFT, CENTER, and RIGHT may be specified.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: The styles ICON_CANCEL and ICON_SEARCH are hints used in combination
 * with SEARCH. When the platform supports the hint, the text control shows
 * these icons. When an icon is selected, a default selection event is sent with
 * the detail field set to one of ICON_CANCEL or ICON_SEARCH. Normally,
 * application code does not need to check the detail. In the case of
 * ICON_CANCEL, the text is cleared before the default selection event is sent
 * causing the application to search for an empty string.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Some text actions such as Undo are not natively supported on all
 * platforms.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: This class is <em>not</em> intended to be subclassed.
