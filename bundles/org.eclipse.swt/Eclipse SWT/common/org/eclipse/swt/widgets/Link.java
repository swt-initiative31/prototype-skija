 * The string can contain both regular text and hyperlinks.  A hyperlink

 * anchor, a single HREF attribute is supported.  When a hyperlink is
 * selected, the text field of the selection event contains either the
 * text of the hyperlink or the value of its HREF, if one was specified.
 * In the rare case of identical hyperlinks within the same string, the
 * HREF attribute can be used to distinguish between them.  The string may
 * include the mnemonic character and line delimiters. The only delimiter
 * the HREF attribute supports is the quotation mark ("). Text containing
 * angle-bracket characters &lt; or &gt; may be escaped using \\, however
 * this operation is a hint and varies from platform to platform.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Mnemonics are indicated by an '&amp;' that causes the next
 * character to be the mnemonic. The receiver can have a
 * mnemonic in the text preceding each link. When the user presses a
 * key sequence that matches the mnemonic, focus is assigned
 * to the link that follows the text. Mnemonics in links and in
 * the trailing text are ignored. On most platforms,
 * the mnemonic appears underlined but may be emphasised in a
 * platform specific manner.  The mnemonic indicator character
 * '&amp;' can be escaped by doubling it in the string, causing
 * a single '&amp;' to be displayed.
