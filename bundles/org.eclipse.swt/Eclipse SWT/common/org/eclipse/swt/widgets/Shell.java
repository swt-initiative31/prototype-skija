/**
 * Instances of this class represent the "windows"
 * which the desktop or "window manager" is managing.
 * Instances that do not have a parent (that is, they
 * are built using the constructor, which takes a
 * <code>Display</code> as the argument) are described
 * as <em>top level</em> shells. Instances that do have
 * a parent are described as <em>secondary</em> or
 * <em>dialog</em> shells.
 * <p>
 * Instances are always displayed in one of the maximized,
 * minimized or normal states:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * When an instance is marked as <em>maximized</em>, the
 * window manager will typically resize it to fill the
 * entire visible area of the display, and the instance
 * is usually put in a state where it can not be resized
 * (even if it has style <code>RESIZE</code>) until it is
 * no longer maximized.
 * </li><li>
 * When an instance is in the <em>normal</em> state (neither
 * maximized or minimized), its appearance is controlled by
 * the style constants which were specified when it was created
 * and the restrictions of the window manager (see below).
 * </li><li>
 * When an instance has been marked as <em>minimized</em>,
 * its contents (client area) will usually not be visible,
 * and depending on the window manager, it may be
 * "iconified" (that is, replaced on the desktop by a small
 * simplified representation of itself), relocated to a
 * distinguished area of the screen, or hidden. Combinations
 * of these changes are also possible.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The <em>modality</em> of an instance may be specified using
 * style bits. The modality style bits are used to determine
 * whether input is blocked for other shells on the display.
 * The <code>PRIMARY_MODAL</code> style allows an instance to block
 * input to its parent. The <code>APPLICATION_MODAL</code> style
 * allows an instance to block input to every other shell in the
 * display. The <code>SYSTEM_MODAL</code> style allows an instance
 * to block input to all shells, including shells belonging to
 * different applications.
 * </p><p>
 * Note: The styles supported by this class are treated
 * as <em>HINT</em>s, since the window manager for the
 * desktop on which the instance is visible has ultimate
 * control over the appearance and behavior of decorations
 * and modality. For example, some window managers only
 * support resizable windows and will always assume the
 * RESIZE style, even if it is not set. In addition, if a
 * modality style is not supported, it is "upgraded" to a
 * more restrictive modality style that is supported. For
 * example, if <code>PRIMARY_MODAL</code> is not supported,
 * it would be upgraded to <code>APPLICATION_MODAL</code>.
 * A modality style may also be "downgraded" to a less
 * restrictive style. For example, most operating systems
 * no longer support <code>SYSTEM_MODAL</code> because
 * it can freeze up the desktop, so this is typically
 * downgraded to <code>APPLICATION_MODAL</code>.</p>

 * the result of combining the constants which are required
 * to produce a typical application top level shell: (that

 * <dd>
 * the result of combining the constants which are required
